    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>50 g yeast</li>
        <li>5 dl milk or water</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar (or honey)</li>
        <li>50 g butter</li>
        <li>10 dl bread roll flour (all-purpose flour is okay too)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve the yeast in lukewarm milk or water.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, salt, grated carrots, and sugar (or honey).</li>
        <li>Mix everything together and add (soft) butter. (Mixing with hands might be easier as the dough gets thicker.)</li>
        <li>Cover the dough (you can use a clean kitchen cloth) and set it aside for 45 - 60 minutes, until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into long bars and cut these into pieces. Roll each portion into a ball and set on the baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Cover the rolls with a kitchen cloth for 20-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bake the rolls on the middle level of the oven for 10-15 min (225 degrees).</li>
